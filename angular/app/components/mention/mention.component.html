                This mail could have come from absolutely anybody masquerading as the sender, could have been read quite legally by the State under the RIP legislation, by the security services of any other state through which the data passes, by the sender's or receiver's employer on the pretext of protection of business interests, and read or altered by anybody working at any of the infrastructure services involved in its transmission. Given that internet routing is complex and adaptive, you don't even know who most of these parties are. Why not use encryption next time?
